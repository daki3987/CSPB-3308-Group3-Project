## Development Methodology

### Scrum: Agile Framework for Iterative Development

- **Sprints**: We organize our work into 2-week sprints, allowing us to focus on specific tasks and deliverables within a defined timeframe.

- **Daily Stand-ups**: Short, daily meetings help us synchronize our efforts, discuss progress, and address any obstacles.

- **Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives**: At the end of each sprint, we review our work with stakeholders and reflect on our processes to identify areas for improvement.

## Risks and Strategy

### Challenges

- **Limited Coding Experience**: As a team, we're relatively new to coding, which may impact our development speed and complexity handling.

- **Time Zone Differences**: Our team members are spread across different time zones, leading to asynchronous collaboration and potential delays in real-time communication.

- **Small Team Size**: With a compact team, resource allocation and multitasking are essential to meet project milestones.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Structured Communication**: We've established a dedicated Discord channel to facilitate updates and discussions, ensuring consistent communication despite time zone differences.

- **Focused Development**: Concentrating on core features and maintaining a clear project scope helps in managing workload effectively within our team capacity.

- **Iterative Feature Addition**: Starting with essential features and gradually introducing new ones based on user feedback and project progress, allowing for manageable scaling and continuous improvement.
