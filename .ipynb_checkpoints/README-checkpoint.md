# Recipe Handbook – Online Recipe Website

**Recipe Handbook** is a collaborative project aimed at creating a user-friendly online platform for discovering, sharing, and organizing recipes. Built with HTML and CSS, the website offers a clean and responsive design for an optimal user experience. Users can easily explore recipes from around the world, discovering new flavors and culinary traditions.
By providing a platform that is both accessible and engaging, we aim to inspire individuals to explore new cuisines, enhance their cooking skills, and share their culinary creations with others.

# Motivation

While we start to work each other, we just reliazed that all of use from different cultural background and timezone.
Despite our diverse cultural backgrounds, we believe that food serves as a universal language. By creating **Recipe Handbook**, we aim to share and celebrate our unique culinary traditions, fostering understanding and connection among people worldwide.

## Development Methodology

### Scrum: Agile Framework for Iterative Development

- **Sprints**: We organize our work into 2-week sprints, allowing us to focus on specific tasks and deliverables within a defined timeframe.

- **Daily Stand-ups**: Short, daily meetings help us synchronize our efforts, discuss progress, and address any obstacles.

- **Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives**: At the end of each sprint, we review our work with stakeholders and reflect on our processes to identify areas for improvement.

## Risks and Strategy

### Challenges

- **Limited Coding Experience**: As a team, we're relatively new to coding, which may impact our development speed and complexity handling.

- **Time Zone Differences**: Our team members are spread across different time zones, leading to asynchronous collaboration and potential delays in real-time communication.

- **Small Team Size**: With a compact team, resource allocation and multitasking are essential to meet project milestones.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Structured Communication**: We've established a dedicated Discord channel to facilitate updates and discussions, ensuring consistent communication despite time zone differences.

- **Focused Development**: Concentrating on core features and maintaining a clear project scope helps in managing workload effectively within our team capacity.

- **Iterative Feature Addition**: Starting with essential features and gradually introducing new ones based on user feedback and project progress, allowing for manageable scaling and continuous improvement.
